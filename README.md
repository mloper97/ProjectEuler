# Project Euler

To quote the Project Euler site at https://projecteuler.net/, "Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems."

This repository contains my solutions, as they're completed, to the first 100 Project Euler problems, those which the creators of Project Euler allow solutions to be shared online.

So far, since I began this project on March 25, 2020, I have completed 7 problems.
